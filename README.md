# Sentimental-Analysis

This repository contains code for real-time emotion detection using a webcam. The program uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect emotions in faces captured by the webcam.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* OpenCV

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

``` git clone https://github.com/abhimanyuA3/emotion-detection-webcam.git ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
